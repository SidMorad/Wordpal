subject : Word collection lesson one

description : Wordpal works with Word collections. Each collection contains
 a lesson that offers couple of new words to learn. Users could select or
 unselect Word collections(lessons) for their current day. Lesson one has
 a little bit different logic than other lessons. Lesson one is free and

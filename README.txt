# Note for developers

# Currently we build projects with Eclipse(powered with ADT plugin).
# So import projects into eclipse and continue from there.

# see also Refs/*.txt for reviewing history of done features, tasks and
# stories.
# $ git log --reverse is good for review too.

# TODO: improve this readme file.
